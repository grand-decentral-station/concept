# Monetization

The monetization is not a key point of the concept or GDS it self. GDS is fully
prescribe to the open source spirit. The here described revenue models are ways
to support GDS and not personal profit. Developing a competitive alternative to
existing solutions is a tonne of work. A possible purpose for the made revenue
could be to pay designated developers or external security audits.


## Possible revenue models

* crowd funding (best fit for the open character of the project)
* selling enterprise support
* selling hosting
* selling GDS modules/carriages
* selling support infrastructure (domains, backup space, ...)
* selling branding (GDS compatible badge)
* donations
