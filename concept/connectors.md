# Connectors

While the decentralized approach of services and applications should be the focus of this project, it's also important to provide connectors to existing services, even if they are data silos.

So Grand Central Station should also contain connectors to:

- Dropbox ([API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers))
- Google Drive ([API](https://developers.google.com/drive/))
- iCloud ([API via OS X/iOS client](https://developer.apple.com/icloud/index.php))
- etc.
 
While software may be based on and encourage a certain mind set, it should not "educate" it's users about the "right way" to perform certain tasks. So while users may strive to use a decentralized, self-hosted environment, there may be good reasons they can't fully embrace this approach: Like clients or partners using different systems for data exchange or third-party tools and services with limited options of data exchange.

Although, a note might be added explaining that while using these services, [data leaves the self-controlled environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkpoint_Charlie).
