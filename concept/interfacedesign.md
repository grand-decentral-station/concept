# Interfacedesign

## The Grand Decentral Panel

The admin interface for the installation and management of applications and settings should be very polished and easy to understand. It should not remind users of the underlying technology and make them forget that they are handling their own server. Instead it should be similar to the home screen of iOS devices with a simple navigation concept and very reduced complexity. In this context it should be noted that the GDS is first and foremost a tool that must not be mistaken for a lifestyle product. Therefore the interface should follow a clean, utilitarian approach with a focus on the task at hand. The interface should be accessible from any mobile or desktop browser. 

## Application Interface Design

Applications shouldn't be pushed to follow a strict interface guideline. It should be possible for any application to follow their own branding and style, but there should be detailed recommendations and a common user interface guide, which can be used as a basis. 

## App Switcher

There should be a simple way to switch between apps, which doesn't take much screen estate and hides whenever possible. A concept for this has yet to be found. The current iCloud-App switcher might be a good starting point.
