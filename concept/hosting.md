# Hosting

There are various scenarios how Grand Decentral Station could be made available for all kinds of users with different technology-skill-levels. Each of those scenarios could be easily combined with each other to fulfill the needs of individuals in the target group. 

## 1. Managed Hosting

To offer a simple entry point to a personal Grand Decentral Station for everyone a collaboration with various hosting providers would make sense. Together with those a unified sign up process could be designed, so that users have a choice which provider to choose and sign up would be as simple as possible. 

Such a sign up system would need to be very close or even more simple than the steps you have to take to sign up for a service like Dropbox or Facebook. 

Personal data, that hosting providers have to collect during the sign up process and such data as credit card details could automatically be redirected to the Grand Decentral Station, one the sign up process is completed. Thus it wouldn't be necessary to enter those details again. It's even thinkable that the hosting provider would not store those details in an additional central database, but only on the Grand Decentral Station of each user. But that raises some legal questions and might not be possible or pratical. 

Changing a hosting provider should be as simple as possible. Grand Decentral Station should offer support for such a process and give a simple and secure way to migrate from one system to another. The same applies to moving from a managed hosted version of Grand Decentral Station to your own server or a Grand Decentral Station device at home. 

## 2. On a dedicated or virtual private server

For people with their own servers and technology background, there would be an image available that they could install on their servers. It would need an additional configuration assistant to handle the installation process in the best possible way. Migration from a hosted version of Grand Decentral station or your own Grand Decentral Station device should be supported. Any additional command-line hackery should be avoided. 

## 3. On its own device 

With the reliance on hardware manufacturers, this part of the concept is more unlikely to happen in the first steps as the first two options. But as a consequence this would offer a way of truly self-hosting your data, with some possible additional issues. 

Such a device could be very similar to what protonet is doing or what the Filetransporter project offers. The device would be as small and simple as possible. A simple attractive box with a single power button and connections for additional USB drives and an ethernet cable should be available. Further hardware specs should be written by someone with more technical knowledge in this field and after the software itself is a step further and hardware requirements are more calculable. 

The device would be connected either to a wifi or via ethernet and it would handle an automatic connection process to the internet as good as possible, with the additional options to configure the connection yourself. 

To handle traffic to and from the device in case of no available static IP it should be very simple to connect the device with a dynamic IP service. 

## 4. On a personal computer 

It is thinkable that Grand Decentral Station could also be running as an application on your personal computer. The connectivity to the web would be limited to the uptime of your computer, but that could be compensated by additional concepts to share server power between friends in the network of Grand Decentral Stations, so your trusted friends would take over hosting parts of your services and vice versa. This is very much theoretical yet though.

See [Issue #3](https://github.com/grand-decentral-station/concept/issues/3) for more thoughts about this idea.

## 5. On a small dedicated box the user already has

Other possible devices for GDS are:

- "low end boxes", i.e. small VPSes with only a small amount of RAM.
- Raspberry Pi's
- just about anything capable of running a current Linux Kernel and a bit of Hard Drive Space.

See [Issue #11](https://github.com/grand-decentral-station/concept/issues/11) for more thoughts about this.
